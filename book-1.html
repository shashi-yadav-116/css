<p><b>Mahabharata, (Sanskrit: “Great Epic of the Bharata Dynasty”) :</b>It is one of the two Sanskrit epic poems of ancient India (the other being the Ramayana). The <u>Mahabharata </u>is an important source of information on the Mahabharata, (Sanskrit: “Great Epic of the Bharata Dynasty”) one of the two Sanskrit epic poems of ancient India (the other being the Ramayana).    Many ancient kingdoms participated as allies of the rival groups in the battle that occurred in Kurukshetra, whose modern-day location is the state of Haryana. The number 18 is an important number in Mahabharata; Duryodhana had 11 Akshouhini soldiers and Pandavas had 7, making a total of eighteen; there are eighteen chapters in the epic, and last but not least, the war lasted exactly for eighteen days, since sunrise to sunset.<br>

The poem is made up of almost 100,000 couplets—about seven times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined—divided into 18 parvans, or sections, plus a supplement titled Harivamsha (“Genealogy of the God Hari”; i.e., of Vishnu).<br> Although it is unlikely that any single person wrote the poem, its authorship is traditionally ascribed to the sage Vyasa, who appears in the work as the grandfather of the Kauravas and the Pandavas. The date and even the historical occurrence of the war that is the central event of the Mahabharata are much debated.<br>

 <p><b>The Mahabharata, also called, The Kurukshetra War is a war described in the Hindu-epic, Mahabharata.</b><br> The conflict arose between two groups of cousins, the Kauravas, and the Pandavas, due to the struggle for dynastic succession to the throne of Hastinapura, in an Indian kingdom called Kuru.
    Many ancient kingdoms participated as allies of the rival groups in the battle that occurred in Kurukshetra, whose modern-day location is the state of Haryana. The number 18 is an important number in Mahabharata; Duryodhana had 11 Akshouhini soldiers and Pandavas had 7, making a total of eighteen; there are eighteen chapters in the epic, and last but not least, the war lasted exactly for eighteen days, since sunrise to sunset.<br>

    <p><h3>In the beginning, Sanjaya gives a description of the various continents of the Earth:</h3> The other planets, and focuses on the Indian Subcontinent, then gives an elaborate list of hundreds of kingdoms, tribes, provinces, cities, towns, villages, rivers, mountains, forests, etc. of the (ancient) Indian Subcontinent (Bharata Varsha).    Many ancient kingdoms participated as allies of the rival groups in the battle that occurred in Kurukshetra, whose modern-day location is the state of Haryana. The number 18 is an important number in Mahabharata; Duryodhana had 11 Akshouhini soldiers and Pandavas had 7, making a total of eighteen; there are eighteen chapters in the epic, and last but not least, the war lasted exactly for eighteen days, since sunrise to sunset.<br>

        He also explains the military formations adopted by each side on each day, the death of each hero, and the details of each war racing.

        In the Bhagavad Gita chapter 1, verses 12 to 18, most of the warriors blew their transcendental conch shells (Shankhas) to start the<b> Kurukshetra war.</b></p>

    <p><h3>Role in Kurukshetra:</h3>Karna was born with aspects of his divine father Surya – the earrings and armour breastplate – that made him an immortal at birth. However, despite being warned, Karna prefers to lose these natural gifts in order to uphold his reputation as the one who always gives dāna (charity), particularly to Brahmins, as being more important than his own life.[95][42][30]

        As the battle-to-death between Karna and Arjuna becomes certain, Kunti – the mother of both, faints and later weeps in sorrow that her boys are bent on killing each other. In parallel, Arjuna's brothers and Indra – the father of Arjuna and a major Vedic deity – plan ways to make Karna mortal.[96] Surya meets Karna and warns him of Indra's plan to appear disguised as a Brahmin to divest him of his earrings and breastplate, and thereby his immortality. Karna disregards this warning and says that if the king of gods Indra comes to beg before him, and if he charitably gives to Indra, it will bring him "renown and fame", then argues that "fame is more important to him than anything else".[97] Indra appears as predicted, and Karna cuts his birthmarks of immortality with a knife, and gives the blood-soaked donation to disguised-as-a-Brahmin Indra. The leader of gods in return praises him and gives him a missile that can only be used once and will kill any mortal or immortal.[98]
        
        Karna keeps the Indra's missile in reserve since it could only be used once, and aims to kill Arjuna with it. By the thirteenth day of the Mahabharata war, numerous soldiers, kings, brothers and sons of Kauravas (Karna's side) and Pandavas (Arjuna's side) had been killed, many by foul means.[99][100] The war had entered a brutal stage, according to the Mahabharata verses in sections 7.150–156. On the fourteenth day, Arjuna took revenge of his own son's death, while Bhima and his son Ghatotkacha wreaked havoc on numerous Kaurava battalions. The war that previously started after sunrise and stopped at sunset, did not stop on the fourteenth day's sunset as both armies continued a ferocious war to kill each other.[99][100] Bhima's son Ghatotkacha had a rakshasha lineage, and his powers of illusion to confuse the enemies grew to enormous proportions as the war dragged deeper into the fifteenth night.[101] Duryodhana and Karna's Kaurava friends plead that they are finished unless Karna does whatever it takes to kill Ghatotkacha. Karna hurls the "Indra missile" to kill Ghatotkacha. Karna thus saves his reputation among his soldiers, launches the missile and kills Ghatotkacha. Duryodhana and Kaurava army rejoice with the death of Bhima's son Ghatotkacha, but now Karna had exhausted the weapon that gave him an advantage over Arjuna.</p>
